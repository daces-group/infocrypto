## Grading Policy

### Class Participation (20%)

- Attendance is mandatory for all lectures, with a maximum of three unexcused absences allowed.
- Each student must (co)scribe at least one lecture during the course.

### Quizzes (20%)

- There will be 2 (in-class) short quizzes to gauge studentsâ€™ understanding of the fundamentals.
- The first and second quizzes will be given in the middle and end of the semester, respectively.
  
### Project (60%)
Students will work on projects related to one or more of the covered topics.
The project is divided into four components:
- Proposal: 15%
- Mid-term report: 15%
- Final presentation: 15%
- Final report: 15%
